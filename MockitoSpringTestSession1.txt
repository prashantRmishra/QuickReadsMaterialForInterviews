Mockito - mocking framework
it will help us to not only test the service but also our controller layer.


the layer where  I want to test should use @InjectMocks and if class uses 
another class object using @Autowired we use @Mock annotation for that 


and we use MockMvc class methods to test the controller
like MockMvc.test()


when(...).thenReturn(...);// it is mock implementation
