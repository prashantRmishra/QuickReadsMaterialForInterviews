Activities 
requirement gathering - jira,rally,azure boards
analyzing requirement - jira,rally aure boards
code review - sonar/ whitesoure bolt/fxcop/resharper
test panning - microsoft test manager/jira (they help in test planning and creating test caeses )
compilation and packaging  - creating  a package that can be deployed like - ant/maven/gradle (for java)
testing - unit/integration/system/load
deployment - creating multiple environment
provisioning - create infrastructure
configuration management - ansible/puppet/chef

STAKE HOLDERS IN DEVOPS
----
po: product owner
scrum master
devs
QA team
BA
consultants
----------
there are certain solution that help to do all this ,
asure devops is a end to end set of tools that helps us to do end to end automation .
---------------------------------
There are lots of devops solution tools likes jenkins , teamct, gitlab, etc.
------------------------------
JENKINS
-----------
scope of jenkins is-

CI PIPELINE##
coding 
code review
compilation
packaging

CD PIPELINE##
testing
deployment
provisioning : creating infrastructure
configuration management
------------------------ 
why should we use jenkins 
-----
it is open source (as no cost involved)
it has plugins , it can work with all platforms python/java/ruby/.net/c++
it is flexible and transparent. 
cons--
In general jenkins implementation may require additional efforts and time (example everything is already there in azure devops hence development is faster in azure devops)
-----------------------------
WHAT IS CI AND CD PIPELINE 
 
CI PIPELINE 
continuous integration pipeline
pull source code (c#,java,python)----->code analysis------> compile----->unit test cases executed/integration--->generate code coverage result and publish---->packaging


CD PIPELINE
continuous deployment pipeline
---get the deployable package --> code analysis that works on raw or compiled code (example whitesource bolting)


OR
continuous delivery pipeline
