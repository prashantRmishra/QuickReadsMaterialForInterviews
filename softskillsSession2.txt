communication  skills are very important 
my barrier to communication ----
are expectation and prejudices
its important to be in the conversation, say something and let people know 
that you are listening 
it is very critical during communication your tone 
a lot of times your tone goes down 
work on that 
try to blend it with your speech 
when you tell somebody that you 
your face should tell everybody that you really like what you are telling 
suyesh like that 
sorry the audience like online gaming 
tell on that 
under that perticular topic so if i go back to the topic of cricket
it is 
one more communication i don't have any fear 
I have to share of my fear 
but believe me even 
till prepare my self 
I would topic is on the tips that is why I prepare 
my self for that 
communucation skills your topic you can coach teach professionals 
if let say tommorow teenagers on communication skills 
what do you think hr projects they won't even get these words in vocabulary

amazing learn the tool and technique to,
you need some powerpoint just put your point their and making mistakes are not bad
but when you are not learning from them then its wrong
If you have decided that you are going to tell about the project

when you discuss the project report which you want to share with your 
supervisor you back it up with certain facts and figure
you are team leader
