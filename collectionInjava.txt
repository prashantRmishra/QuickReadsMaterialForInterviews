collection interface
defined from jdk 1.2 onwards
represents single unit of object
Its a framework that provides ready-made architecture
--------------
it can be used to perform all the ds algorithm
It reduces the no of lines of codes that we write, they are resizable.


List:
Allows ordered sequence of insertion 
manupulation is faster in linked list 
searching is faster in arrayList


set:
it stores the values in unordered manner
can not allow duplicate values to be preesnt in the set
only one null value allowed in the set (Hashset and treeSet)
TreeSet
uses tree for storage
the elements are stored in ascending order
uses red black tree

the question that I have are 
red black tree
------------------bookStore app changes-----
